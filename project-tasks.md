  }>
  metadata: {
    created_at: string
    updated_at: string
  }
}
```

Cache key format: `pr-review-state-${owner}-${repo}-${prNumber}`

Implementation should:

- Use `@actions/cache` for state persistence
- Save state after each tool invocation that modifies it

- Parse comment bodies to extract assessment JSON
- Reconstruct thread history from replies
- Determine thread status from conversation

**Technical Details:**

State rebuild logic:

1. Fetch all PR review comments using GitHub API
2. Parse each comment for hidden assessment JSON (in HTML comments)
3. Build thread structure from comment replies
4. Infer status:
   - PENDING: Thread has no resolution
   - RESOLVED: Thread was explicitly resolved
   - DISPUTED: Developer replied without agent concession
5. Store rebuild timestamp for cache invalidation

Comment format should include hidden metadata:

```markdown
<!-- review-assessment
{
  "finding": "...",
  "assessment": "...",
  "score": 6
}
-->

[Visible comment body for developers]
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] State can be fully rebuilt from GitHub comments
- [ ] Thread relationships are preserved

Do NOT suggest architectural changes in this pass.

Files changed: [list]
Diff: [diff content]
```

**Pass 2: Structural/Layered Review**

```
You are conducting Pass 2 of 4 in a multi-pass code review.

Goal: Understand how changes fit into the broader codebase. Use read/grep/glob tools to:
- Trace function call chains
- Verify interface contracts
- Check for unused imports/exports
- Identify inconsistencies with similar patterns

Previous pass findings: [Pass 1 summary]
```

**Pass 3: Security & AGENTS.md Compliance**

```
You are conducting Pass 3 of 4 in a multi-pass code review.

Goal: Security audit and rule enforcement:
- Access control issues
- Data integrity risks
- AGENTS.md violations (if file exists)
- Architectural standards

Security sensitivity: [determined from package.json/README]
AGENTS.md content: [content if exists, or "Not found"]
```

**Pass 4: Consolidation & Noise Reduction**

```
You are conducting Pass 4 of 4 in a multi-pass code review.

Goal: Final review of all findings:
- Remove redundant comments
- Combine related issues
- Verify score accuracy
- Ensure proportionality of suggestions

All findings from passes 1-3: [consolidated list]

Submit only high-confidence, high-value feedback.
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**

### Task 4.2: Implement Review Orchestrator

**Objective:** Create the orchestrator that manages the 4-pass review workflow
within a single OpenCode session.

**Changes Required:**

- Implement sequential pass execution
- Manage context between passes
- Handle pass completion and transitions
- Aggregate results across passes

**Technical Details:**

Orchestrator responsibilities:

1. Initialize OpenCode session with system prompt
2. Execute Pass 1 with diff context
3. Wait for `submit_pass_results()` tool call
4. Execute Pass 2 with Pass 1 summary
5. Wait for `submit_pass_results()` tool call
6. Execute Pass 3 with security context and AGENTS.md
7. Wait for `submit_pass_results()` tool call
8. Execute Pass 4 with all previous findings
9. Wait for `submit_pass_results()` tool call
10. Generate final review summary

Context management:

- All passes run in same OpenCode session (no state resets)
- Pass summaries are accumulated and passed to subsequent passes
- OpenCode manages its own file context
- State is preserved across passes via OpenCode's internal mechanisms

Error handling:

- If a pass fails, retry once before failing the action
- If agent doesn't call `submit_pass_results()`, timeout after 10 minutes
- Log detailed information about each pass for debugging

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] All 4 passes execute sequentially
- [ ] Context flows correctly between passes
- [ ] Pass completion is detected via tool call
- [ ] Timeouts prevent infinite loops
- [ ] Errors in one pass don't crash entire review

### Task 4.3: Implement Fix Verification on Subsequent Commits

**Objective:** When new commits are pushed to the PR, verify if previous issues
were addressed.

**Changes Required:**

- Load previous review state
- Compare new code against pending issues
- Auto-resolve threads when fixes are detected
- Re-raise issues that remain unaddressed

**Technical Details:**

Verification logic:

1. Load state from cache (contains previous issues)
2. For each PENDING or DISPUTED thread:
   - Check if the file/line still exists in new commit
   - Use OpenCode to analyze if the issue still applies
   - If fixed, call `github_resolve_thread()` with explanation
   - If still present, add follow-up comment
3. Run full 4-pass review on new changes only
4. Cross-reference new findings with old state to avoid duplicates

Agent should receive context:

```
Previous review state:
- 5 issues were raised in the last review
- 2 are marked as DISPUTED
- 3 are PENDING

Your task for this review:
1. Verify if any of the 5 previous issues are now fixed
2. Review the new changes (commits: abc123..def456)
3. Do not re-raise issues that are already tracked
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] Previous issues are loaded from state
- [ ] Agent verifies each previous issue
- [ ] Fixed issues are auto-resolved with explanation
- [ ] Unfixed issues are followed up
- [ ] New review doesn't duplicate existing issues
- [ ] Cross-file fixes are detected

      return
    }

    // 4. Start OpenCode server
    const server = new OpenCodeServer(config.opencode)
    await server.start()

    // 5. Initialize OpenCode client with custom tools
    const client = new OpenCodeClient(server.url)
    await client.initialize()
    await client.registerTools(createGitHubTools(github))

    // 6. Load review state
    const state = await loadOrRebuildState(github, config)

    // 7. Execute review
    const orchestrator = new ReviewOrchestrator(client, github, state, config)
    const result = await orchestrator.executeReview()

    // 8. Save state to cache
    await saveState(state, config)

    // 9. Set outputs
    core.setOutput('comments_posted', result.commentsPosted)
    core.setOutput('blocking_issues', result.hasBlockingIssues)
  } catch (error) {
    if (error instanceof Error) {
      core.setFailed(error.message)
    }
  } finally {

### Task 5.2: Implement Logging and Debugging

**Objective:** Add comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring.

**Changes Required:**

- Create logger utility
- Add debug logging throughout
- Include timing information
- Log tool invocations

**Technical Details:**

  warning(message: string, context?: object): void
  error(message: string, error?: Error, context?: object): void
  startGroup(name: string): void
  endGroup(): void
}
```

Logging points:

- Action startup with configuration (sanitize API keys)
- OpenCode server lifecycle events
- Each review pass start/end with timing
- Tool invocations with parameters (sanitize sensitive data)
- GitHub API calls with response status
- State save/restore operations
- Errors with full stack traces

Use GitHub Actions log groups for organization:

  ) {
    super(message)
  }
}

export class OpenCodeServerError extends ReviewError {}
export class GitHubAPIError extends ReviewError {}
export class StateError extends ReviewError {}
export class ConfigurationError extends ReviewError {}
```

Retry logic:

- GitHub API: Retry up to 3 times with exponential backoff
- OpenCode server start: Retry once
- Tool invocations: No retries (agent should handle)
- State save: Retry up to 2 times

Error recovery:

- If OpenCode server crashes mid-review, restart and continue from last pass
- If GitHub API rate limited, wait and retry
- If state save fails, log warning but don't fail action
- If cache restore fails, rebuild from comments

User-facing error messages should:

- Explain what went wrong
- Suggest how to fix it
- Include relevant context (PR number, file, etc.)
- Avoid exposing sensitive information

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] Error types are well-defined
- [ ] Transient failures are retried appropriately
- [ ] Error messages are clear and actionable
- [ ] Errors don't leak sensitive data
- [ ] Unrecoverable errors fail fast

## Phase 7: Advanced Features

### Task 7.1: Implement Score Elevation for Low-Score Issues

**Objective:** Allow multiple low-score issues to be collectively elevated when
they exceed a threshold.

**Changes Required:**

- Track low-score issues during review
- Apply elevation logic when threshold is met
- Document elevated issues in comments

**Technical Details:**

Elevation logic:

1. During Pass 4 (consolidation), count issues below `problem_score_threshold`
2. If count >= `score_elevation_threshold`:
   - Create a single elevated comment summarizing all issues
   - Assign elevated score (based on collective impact)
   - Post as a regular comment (not per-line)
3. Original low-score issues are not posted individually

Example elevated comment:

```markdown
## Elevated Issues (5 minor improvements)

While individually these issues are below the threshold (score < 5),
collectively they indicate a pattern worth addressing:

1. **Inconsistent naming** (score: 3) - Variables `data`, `d`, `userData` used
   interchangeably
2. **Missing docs** (score: 4) - 3 public functions lack JSDoc
3. **Redundant code** (score: 3) - Similar logic duplicated in lines 42 and 87
4. **Verbose conditionals** (score: 3) - If/else blocks could use ternary
5. **Generic variable names** (score: 2) - Multiple uses of `temp`, `result`

Collective score: 6 (elevated from average 3)
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] Low-score issues are tracked during review
- [ ] Elevation threshold is respected
- [ ] Elevated comments are clear and helpful
- [ ] Elevation logic is tested
- [ ] Configuration option works correctly

**Files to Create:**

- None (extend existing files)

**Files to Modify:**

- `src/review/orchestrator.ts`
- `src/opencode/tools.ts`

### Task 7.2: Implement Security Sensitivity Detection

**Objective:** Automatically detect if the repository handles sensitive data and
adjust security scoring accordingly.

**Changes Required:**

- Analyze package.json for financial/PII-related dependencies
- Check README for security indicators
- Auto-promote security findings by +2 points
- Document sensitivity in review context

**Technical Details:**

Detection heuristics:

1. **Package dependencies** indicating sensitivity:
   - `stripe`, `paypal`, `braintree` → Financial
   - `passport`, `auth0`, `oauth` → Authentication/PII
   - `crypto`, `bcrypt`, `jsonwebtoken` → Security-critical
2. **README keywords**:
   - "payment", "credit card", "financial" → Financial
   - "HIPAA", "PII", "personal data", "GDPR" → PII
   - "security", "encryption", "authentication" → Security-critical

3. **File patterns**:
   - Presence of `SECURITY.md` → Security-conscious project
   - Encryption configs in repo → Sensitive data handling

Security score promotion:

- If sensitivity detected, add +2 to all security-related findings (Pass 3)
- Document sensitivity in review header:
  ```markdown
  ⚠️ This repository handles financial data. Security findings are elevated
  (+2).
  ```

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] Sensitivity is detected from package.json
- [ ] README keywords are analyzed
- [ ] Security scores are promoted correctly
- [ ] Detection is logged for transparency
- [ ] False positives are minimized

**Files to Create:**

- `src/review/security.ts`

**Files to Modify:**

- `src/review/orchestrator.ts`
- `src/review/prompts.ts`

---

### Task 7.3: Implement AGENTS.md Support

**Objective:** Load and enforce project-specific rules from `AGENTS.md` file if
present.

**Changes Required:**

- Check for AGENTS.md in repository root
- Load and parse the file
- Include content in Pass 3 prompt
- Flag violations with appropriate severity

**Technical Details:**

AGENTS.md handling:

1. Check if file exists at repository root
2. If present, fetch content via GitHub API
3. Parse for explicit rules (checkboxes, lists, headings)
4. Include full content in Pass 3 system prompt
5. Agent should identify violations and score based on rule criticality

Pass 3 prompt enhancement:

```
This repository has an AGENTS.md file with project-specific rules:

--- BEGIN AGENTS.md ---
[file content]
--- END AGENTS.md ---

You must:
1. Identify any violations of rules in AGENTS.md
2. Score violations based on the rule's importance:
   - "MUST" / "REQUIRED" rules → score 8+
   - "SHOULD" / "RECOMMENDED" rules → score 6-7
   - "MAY" / "OPTIONAL" rules → score 4-5
3. Reference the specific rule in your finding
```

Example finding:

```markdown
**AGENTS.md Rule Violation** (score: 8)

Finding: Direct database queries in UI component

Assessment: The file `UserProfile.tsx` makes direct database calls, violating
the rule "UI components MUST use the service layer for data access" (AGENTS.md,
line 42).

This breaks architectural boundaries and makes testing difficult.
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] AGENTS.md is detected when present
- [ ] File content is loaded correctly
- [ ] Rules are enforced in Pass 3
- [ ] Violations are scored appropriately
- [ ] Missing AGENTS.md doesn't cause errors
- [ ] Rule references are included in findings

**Files to Create:**

- None (extend existing files)

**Files to Modify:**

- `src/review/prompts.ts`
- `src/review/orchestrator.ts`
- `src/github/api.ts`

---

### Task 7.4: Implement Dispute Resolution Logic

**Objective:** Handle developer disputes of raised issues with intelligent
resolution logic.

**Changes Required:**

- Detect when developer disputes an issue
- Agent evaluates the reasoning
- Agent decides to concede or maintain position
- Escalate unresolved disputes to human reviewers

**Technical Details:**

Dispute handling flow:

1. **Detection**: Monitor for developer replies to agent comments
2. **Classification**: Determine if reply is:
   - Acknowledgment (will fix)
   - Dispute (disagrees with finding)
   - Question (needs clarification)
   - Out-of-scope (will fix later)

3. **Agent evaluation** (automated via OpenCode):
   - Re-examine the code with dispute reasoning
   - Assess if reasoning is valid
   - Consider:
     - Is the original finding still accurate?
     - Does the explanation address the concern?
     - Is the proposed alternative acceptable?
     - Does "fix later" introduce temporary risk?

4. **Resolution actions**:
   - **Concede**: Call `github_reply_to_thread(is_concession=true)` + resolve
   - **Maintain**: Explain why finding still stands
   - **Escalate**: Request human reviewer (if configured)

Example dispute scenarios:

**Scenario 1: Valid dispute (agent concedes)**

```
Agent: "This nested loop is O(n²), consider using a Map for O(n)" (score: 6)
Dev: "The array is always <10 items (config validation ensures this), so O(n²) is acceptable"
Agent: "You're correct. Given the size constraint, the performance impact is negligible. Conceding." [Resolves thread]
```

**Scenario 2: Invalid dispute (agent maintains)**

```
Agent: "Missing authorization check on this endpoint" (score: 9)
Dev: "Authorization is handled by middleware"
Agent: "I've reviewed the middleware, and it only applies to routes in /api/admin/. This endpoint at /api/user/data requires explicit checks. The finding stands."
```

**Scenario 3: Future fix risk (agent rejects)**

```
Agent: "Race condition in payment processing" (score: 9)
Dev: "Acknowledged, will fix in next sprint"
Agent: "This creates a data corruption risk in production. The PR should not merge until this is addressed, as the impact is critical."
```

State updates for disputes:

- Thread status becomes "DISPUTED"
- Dispute reasoning is stored in thread history
- If agent concedes, status becomes "RESOLVED"
- If agent maintains and dev accepts, status becomes "PENDING"
- If neither concedes, status stays "DISPUTED"

Human escalation (optional feature):

- If configured, tag a human reviewer on disputed threads
- Provide summary of agent vs. developer positions
- Human reviewer makes final call

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] Developer disputes are detected
- [ ] Agent evaluates reasoning intelligently
- [ ] Concessions are handled correctly
- [ ] Agent maintains position when appropriate
- [ ] High-risk "fix later" responses are rejected
- [ ] Dispute state is tracked correctly
- [ ] Human escalation works (if implemented)

**Files to Create:**

- `src/review/dispute.ts`

**Files to Modify:**

- `src/review/orchestrator.ts`
- `src/opencode/tools.ts`
